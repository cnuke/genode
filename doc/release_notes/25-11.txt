Genode-world using the Goa SDK
##############################

; @cnuke, @chelmuth

In the beginning of 2025 we
[https://genode.discourse.group/t/announcement-for-the-restructuring-of-the-world-repository/138 - announced]
our plans to restructure _genode-world_ from a Genode repository into one
that houses Goa projects instead. As we aim for Goa to become the designated
way how software is ported to and even developed for Genode adjusting
_genode-world_ is a natural first step.

The content of the old repository will live on for some finite amount of
time within the _legacy_ sub-directory of the repository to ease the
ongoing transition phase. If you are still relying on software from this
repository you may have to replace your current checkout to keep it
operational.

Replace the 'repos/world' directory with a symlink pointing to the _legacy_
sub-directory within your checkout. In case you followed the original _README_
file it is safe to move your direct checkout directory out of Genode's _repos_
directory:

! mv genode/repos/world ../../genode-world
! ln -sf <path>/genode-world/legacy genode/repos/world

Afterwards the repository can be used as before like a regular Genode
repository, further alterations are not necessary.

Since Goa is now required to contribute to _genode-world_, the first step
is setting it up and making your self comfortable using it. The
[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-applications-25-04.pdf - Genode Applications book]
will help you along the way. It describes how to install Goa, how to set it
up and also contains practical tutorials encouraging you to get your feet wet.
Keeping it close while starting your journey is strongly recommended.

_A word of caution, which mirrors what is also noted in the_
_[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-applications-25-04.pdf - Genode Applications book]._
_Goa expects a recent Ubuntu LTS version, as this is currently the_
_recommended Linux distribution to develop Genode on, because it assumes a_
_certain feature set in the tools it builds upon. That includes tools_
_it uses directly, like bubblewrap to implement its sandboxing mechanism,_
_as well as the build-systems it incorporates and manages. These are tied_
_to the project using them where version checks might fail or required_
_features are missing in case the tool provided by the Linux distribution_
_is too old. We noticed that with 'cmake' and 'Meson'._
_Assistance with commonly encountered short-comings is given at the end_
_of this section._

As the technical aspects of using Goa are already well covered in the book,
let us dive into the conventions established within this shared Goa projects
repository. Note that these conventions are not set in stone as they are
still evolving and should rather be perceived as guide lines we may amend.


Conventions in genode-world
---------------------------

In its current iteration the various Goa projects are loosely categorized
by top-level directories that roughly define which type of software is to
expected inside, e.g. 'database' contains a port of sqlite3.

The notable exceptions are the 'legacy' and 'pkg' directories:

* :legacy: contains the content of the original _genode-world_ repository,
   whose existence is discussed above.

* :pkg: contains pkg archives that accumulate all dependencies for a given
  component version. Those dependencies may be more volatile than the actual
  component version, e.g. the sqlite3 version does not change and neither
  does the API version of the libc but the version of the libc library
  implementing this API changes.

As a fitting category directory might not yet exist for a new project,
creating one can be necessary. For that common sense resting on the
project itself, e.g. linphone could be put either into network or voip,
and/or consulting how other projects/OSes categorize their software,
e.g. the various *BSD ports collections, is a valid approach.

_Note that we are still in an experimental phase and the categorization_
_gives the repository some degree of structure and is meant as aid for_
developers._
_Goa itself is indifferent to how project repositories are structured_
_internally._

Since the _genode-world_ repository follows the current Sculpt OS release and
for that matter depends on depot archives that are managed within the Genode
repository, these archives are provided by the 'genodelabs' depot user.
Among others they include the archives required by POSIX components like
'libc', 'libm', and 'posix'.
The current list of the archives concerning Goa can be found in the _archives_
file in the _pkg/goa_ depot archive as well as in the Goa repository itself
in _share/goa/goarc_.

These archives should primarily be used in case a project depends on one
of them. All other dependencies and projects, or rather archives, referenced
within _genode-world_ should make use of the wildcard '_' depot user because
_genode-world_ is a shared Goa projects repository. As _pkg/goa_ contains
only a subset of all available archives and is extended on demand you may
stumple upon a dependency for which no readily available 'genodelabs'
archive exists yet. Also using '_' in this case is reasonable but this
circumstance should be noted to be remedied in a later release.

This depot user is special and is replaced with the depot user specified via
the '--depot-user' flag (or the corresponding setting in the _goarc_ file),
this allows different depot users to publish the same project without any
alteration to its ingredients given in the _used_apis_ and _archives_ files.

The version information within this repository is manually managed via its
top-level _goarc_ file for the moment and also makes use of the wildcard user
and thus these information are applied for all other depot users as well.
Bumping a given version of a project should at least happen whenever a new
Sculpt OS version is released.

The usage of the depot wildcard user is in contrast to prior private Goa
projects repositories where the depot user was mostly hard-coded to the
users providing the Goa projects. Those repositories could be updated
as well.


Interplay with Genode repositories
----------------------------------

Using Goa is a one way street in that it is not possible to reference
depot archives created by Goa from archives generated by Genode's
build-system from recipes in a Genode repository. You can depend on archives
produced in this way but not the other way around.

Goa projects are intended for being deployed on Sculpt OS and being tested
with Goa itself using 'goa run' either on base-linux or on a machine running
the 'goa_testbed' pkg on Sculpt OS.

That being said, it is possible to import archives produced by Goa in run-scripts.

For example, the 'legacy/run/chrony.run' run-script contains the following
snippet:

!import_from_depot [depot_user]/src/[base_src] \
!                  [depot_user]/pkg/[drivers_nic_pkg] \
!                  [depot_user]/pkg/system_rtc-[board] \
!                  [depot_user]/src/gmp \
!                  [depot_user]/src/init \
!                  [depot_user]/src/libc \
!                  [depot_user]/src/nic_router \
!                  [depot_user]/src/posix \
!                  [depot_user]/src/stdcxx \
!                  [depot_user]/src/vfs \
!                  [depot_user]/src/vfs_jitterentropy \
!                  [depot_user]/src/vfs_lxip \
!                  [depot_user]/src/vfs_pipe \
!                  [depot_user]/src/nettle/3.7-2025-10-01 \
!                  [depot_user]/src/gnutls/3.6.16-2025-10-02 \
!                  [depot_user]/src/chrony/4.6.1-2025-10-02

As you can see it references a long list of depot archives. Most of them
are managed by Genode's build-system with the help of the depot tools.
The last items in the list refer directly to the current version of 'chrony'
and its dependencies produced by Goa. Since they contain a given version
the 'run' tool can incorporate them without resorting to recipes that do not
exist for Goa projects.

As a consequence the run-script has to be adjusted every time the versions of the
Goa projects change and so this approach should be employed sparingly.

For the time being this approach allows us to test Goa projects within our CI
pipeline while properly intergrating Goa is still an ongoing process.
Extending Goa with more 'run' back ends besides base-linux and Sculpt as well
as provide an autopilot-like experience are some of the puzzle pieces yet to
be placed.


Sandbox build environment on Ubuntu LTS 24.04
---------------------------------------------

Goa provides a sandboxed build environment based on 'bubblewrap'. It confines
the execution of the original build-system of the Goa project to the
pre-configured sandbox in an attempt to prevent any misdoings triggered by
run-away processing in the original build-system.

When using Ubuntu apparmor might interfere with employing bubblewrap.

In case you encounter an error like the following

  'bwrap: loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted'

you have to properly configure apparmor to allow for using user namespaces
with bubblewrap.

The following snippet shows the content of '/etc/apparmor.d/goa' and needs
to be adapted to the path where 'goa' is installed:

!# This profile allows everything and only exists to give the
!# application a name instead of having the label "unconfined"
!
!abi <abi/4.0>,
!include <tunables/global>
!
!profile goa /path/to/goa/bin/goa flags=(unconfined) {
!  userns,
!
!  # Site-specific additions and overrides. See local/README for details.
!  include if exists <local/goa>
!}

Please make sure that the 'apparmor-profiles' package has been
installed. Reloading the apparmor service should lead to a working
sand-boxing with goa:

! systemctl reload apparmor

In contrast to this advice you can also disable sandboxing completely,
either by setting the environment variable 'DISABLE_SANDBOX=1' or adding

! set disable_sandbox 1

to your user's _goarc_ file.


Leaky build-host environment isolation
--------------------------------------

The sandbox mechanism guards against interference problems on the build-host,
like accessing private files or creating files in the wrong locations,
stemming from the build process itself.

However, since the build process at times needs access to tools provided by the
build-host—depending on the build-system—the build process might pick up
configurations purely intend for use by the build-host and not Goa.

This circumstance can show itself by suspicious looking flags, e.g. occurrence
of -I/usr/include/SDL2, or by aborting the build process because there are
unmet dependencies, e.g. libusb-dev is not found, as the build-system's probe
mechanism falls back on the build-host environment rather than Goa.

As dependencies for Goa projects are resolved via the 'used_apis' file that
instructs Goa to set the right compiler and linker flags, building
a project usually should work fine, it is just the build-system's probing
mechanism that needs guidance.

This problem may arise because build-host environments are not necessarily
the same. For example, the creator of the Goa project might have had more
or other development packages installed than the one trying to build the Goa
project afterwards and thus the build-system might behave differently.

In such a case patches to the Goa project in question might be in order.
It is tempting to install additional development packages to trick the
build-system into compliance but restricting the impact of the build-host
pays long-term.

To get a better grasp on the problem building the project with the
'--verbose' argument and checking the artifacts in _var/build_ produced
by the build-process is reasonable:

! goa build --verbose


Enhanced Goa SDK
================

The updated Goa SDK comes with a series of enhancements eliminating a few
points of friction such as the automated tool-chain installation for Rust,
the two-stage build process for Meson projects with executable and library
targets, and the augmented resolution of version information:

Goa always supported re-using other users' depot archives such as ported
libraries. However, determining what version to use has never been properly
addressed apart from a built-in curated list of archives from _genodelabs_. We
therefore equipped Goa with the ability to publish a depot index that contains
the versions not only of pkg archives but also of src and api archives. This
enables users to record and publish certain versions of their ported libraries
or re-usable components. Vice versa, Goa will automatically look up this version
information from a user's depot index if necessary. In addition to version
information, using archives of other users often requires having a look into
their documentation. This is addressed by the new 'info' command that nicely
displays the _README_ file from a selected depot archive.

Further enhancements are aligned to the genode-world use case: We added the
notion of a wildcard depot user to allow different users to publish the same
Goa project in their depot. Moreover, the new 'exported' and 'published'
commands provide assistance in determining whether the exported/published
archives are up-to-date with the project's state. For convenience, we
added a '--if-needed' option to the 'bump-version' command. When provided,
Goa omits bumping a project's version if the exported archive is already
up-to-date.

Internally, we entirely overhauled the parsing of configuration files in Goa
in order to untie it from XML and give way to the new human-oriented
configuration format.

To round things of, we have integrated support for library-based
performance profiling leveraging GCC's '-finstrument-functions'. For more
details on this and the aforementioned changes, please refer to the
corresponding article on genodians.org.

Base framework and OS-level infrastructure
##########################################

Human-inclined data (HID) processing
====================================

With [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.08#Consideration_of_a_lean_alternative_to_XML - Genode 25.08],
we started the practical exploration of a new syntax for configurations and
state reports. The recent Sculpt OS release 25.10 was accompanied with a
flavor that uses the new format by default and allows us to experience all
of our use cases live on daily use.

:Genodians article "Sculpting with less noise and more clarity":

  [https://genodians.org/nfeske/2025-10-30-sculpt-human]

To make this possible, all components relevant for Sculpt OS have been
relieved from their formerly hardwired dependency from XML by using the
'Genode::Node' API.

While practically using and discussing the new format, we quickly found its
original working title (human-readable data - HRD) a little bit unpleasant.
So HRD has been renamed to HID, which stands for human-inclined data.

The benefit of the new format becomes most striking when information lends
itself to be presented in tabular form. For example, a list of Wifi
accesspoints with their respective properties, or a table of session-routing
rules. To ease the output of such tabular data, the 'Generator' API has been
extended with a new 'tabular' method. It instructs the HID generator to format
the contained nodes in tabular way. Two forms are supported: In the presence
of nested nodes, the nodes appear as table columns and attributes appear
densely. With only one node level, attributes are formatted as a table.
Trailing optional attributes are displayed densely.


API curation
============

The 'Thread' API still maintained compatibility to old interfaces we declared
as deprecated already in 2016 when we fully embraced dependency injection and
went on our mission to remove component-global side effects from the API.
Until now, however, some of those old interfaces where relied on by the
framework itself. Those parts have now been reworked, using 'Genode::Runtime'
as token for invoking global side effects, like the interplay with the stack
area. Thanks to these changes, the deprecated Thread constructors could now
be removed.

This change has ripple effects towards all places where 'Thread' objects are
manually constructed, e.g., 'Rpc_entrypoint'. Since all users had to be
adapted anyway, we took the opportunity of removing basic types as constructor
arguments to foster API safety.


Automatic component restart upon stopped heartbeat
==================================================

Genode's existing
[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/25.05/system_configuration/The_init_component.html#Component_health_monitoring - heartbeat-monitoring mechanism]
reflects the condition of a non-responding component in init's state report,
which can be evaluated by a management component to take a deliberate policy
decision. The usual response is the restart of the child by increasing the
child's version attribute. Since this policy has become so proliferated,
however, it is sensible to support it directly in init, eliminating the need
for a separate management component.

The new mechanism can be enabled in the configuration of the init component by
setting the 'restart_after_skipped' attribute of the child's 'heartbeat' node
to a value greater than 0. This way, the maximum rate of restarts can be
controlled per child.

Thanks to this feature, the self-healing abilities of Sculpt OS are no longer
limited to components managed by the system but can now be leveraged for
user-deployed components and launchers. For example, the touchpad driver,
which knowingly fails once every dozen boots on some laptops, is now
automatically restarted when it got stuck, making the touchpad ultimately
available upon the second try, just a few seconds later.

Memory-capped log aggregation
=============================

Sculpt's report file system is an in-memory file system with a statically
defined RAM quota of 16 MiB. Besides aggregating reports of various components
(in particular device drivers), it hosts the _/report/log_ file, which gathers
the diagnostic output of all components. During normal use, the log file is in
the order of 100 KiB. However, in the presence of a rampaging component that
prints messages in an infinite loop, the report file system can eventually
fill up. To counter such situations, we introduced a new VFS plugin.

The new 'ram_log' VFS plugin stores up to a limited number of bytes of an
append-only file in RAM. Should the content written to the file exceed the
configured limit, the oldest content is replaced by zeros, making room for the
most recent logged information in memory. The file still appears growing in
size but only the most recent data remains present. In Sculpt 25.10 the log
is now capped at 1 MiB, effectively protecting the report file system from
exhaustion.

Vaguely related while speaking of Sculpt OS, the 'terminal_log' component has
been changed to prefix each line with a timestamp in seconds, showing one
digit after the comma. Note that this change makes the component depend on
a timer service now.


Simplified configuration of POSIX components
============================================

Tag-value argument pairs of traditional POSIX applications are technically two
distinct arguments, appearing as two consecutive elements in the 'argv' array.
Hence, such pairs have to appear as separate arg nodes in the configuration, e.g.:

! <arg>-geometry</arg> <arg>1024x768</arg>

or in HID syntax:

! + arg | : -geometry
! + arg | : 1024x768

This appears not only as wasteful but also does not convey well that both arg
nodes belong together. We now added the ability to define a pair of 'argv'
elements using a single 'arg' node. By combining an optional 'name' attribute
with quoted content, tag-value arguments can now nicely be expressed as one
arg node:

! <arg name="-geometry">1024x768</arg>

or respectively in HID syntax:

! + arg -geometry | : 1024x768


Streamlined on-target test suite
================================

The depot-autopilot component orchestrates the execution of the framework's
comprehensive test suite on a test target, using Genode's package management.
Each test has the form of a package with its _runtime_ definition augmented
with the success criterion of the test. The depot-autopilot deploys each test
after another, detect successes or failures, and collects the results. The
test suite is currently comprised of around 80 packages.

Even though the depot-autopilot serves us well since
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/18.11#Automated_test_infrastructure_hosted_on_top_of_Genode - introduced in 2018],
code-wise, it has largely remained at its initial stage with a fair share of
ad-hoc decisions.
Our recent move to the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/25.08#Syntax-agnostic_configuration_and_reporting - syntax-agnostic]
'Genode::Node' API ultimately prompted us to rewrite the depot-autopilot
orchestrator and to streamline the suite of tests.

* A test's success criterion is now consistently expressed in the form of
  'succeed' or 'fail' nodes. The long deprecated 'events' declarations are no
  longer supported.

* The support for the 'log_prefix' attribute in 'fail' and 'succeed' nodes
  has been dropped as it has remained unused.

* Time values are now printed with two digits after the comma because
  the milliseconds digit is never inspected in practice.

* The formerly hard-coded '[init]' prefix of each test's log output,
  regardless of whether init was actually being used or not, has been
  removed.

* The meaning of log patters have been slightly tightened:
  The previous version accepted a match of a pattern line against any part
  of a log line. The new version accepts a match only if the pattern line
  matches the log line from the beginning of the line. The previous
  matching semantics can be achieved by starting a pattern line with the
  wildcard '*'.

* Exit codes can now be used as success criterion by specifying an 'exit'
  attribute to 'succeed' and 'fail' nodes. If a 'succeed' node features both
  an exit code and a log pattern, both conditions must be satisfied.

  This feature alleviates the need to wrap a test in an init instance for the
  mere matching of the "child ... has exited ..." message, which was a pattern
  found in about 25% of the test packages. Those tests now benefit from
  simpler runtime definitions and shorter log output.

  Whenever a test completes due to its exit code, the summary report marks the
  test as 'exit'.

* The depot_autopilot.run script changes the LOG label for test output from
  "init -> depot_autopilot" to "init -> test" to reduce the likelihood for
  line breaks.

* The duration of the entire test suite has been reduced by one third,
  mostly due to the tightening of the parameters of time-driven tests.

    Commit "libdrm: move Gpu::Vram into separate namespace"
    (db02e04d0c5465579a3d7d66dac17f2fc5ca830a) lead to an implementation
    where both, lima and etnaviv, inherit from an empty Gpu::Vram class.
    This causes the problem that the ID-space in both implementations is of

    Etnaviv::~Vram) not being called upon destruction, and thus, not freeing
    GPU memory.

    The static page-allocator variant is kept for core's page-table, and
    bootstrap.

    hw: use typed return and id-values in syscalls
    
    * Introduce enum class definitions for syscall IDs
    * Introduce specific return types per syscall with result
    * Eliminate result values, which were never evalulated
    * Distinguish architecture-specific register access from
      system-call argument mapping
    * Evalulate all arguments and return values inside the top-level
      Kernel::Thread::_call member function, only use typed values
      in all sub-functions
    * Name kernel-internal sub-functions for system-call execution
      in a unified fashion like: _call_[kobject]_[function],
      whereby kobject means something like: thread, pd, irq, vcpu,
      or signal, and function can be things like: pause, create, destroy,
      and so on

    base-hw: map cpu-priorities to scheduling-groups
    
    Implement heuristic that matches the intention of Sculpt OS with
    two init-levels: top-level static init with two prioritiy levels,
    and dynamic runtime-init with up to eight priority levels.

    hw: consistently differentiate local and global IC
    
    This patch tries to cleanup the architectural inconsistencies of interrupt
    controller implementations by:
    
    * Consistently differentiate in between Board::Local_interrupt_controller and
      Board::Global_interrupt_controller within kernel and bootstrap
    * The name Board::Pic is thereby replaced by Board::Local_interrupt_controller
    * Move the global parts of ARM's GICv2 and GICv3 to the corresponding
      Board::Global_interrupt_controller classes, replacing dummy ones
    * The maximum number of all (including shared) interrupts is part of the
      Global_interrupt_controller now
    * In bootstrap on platforms where IC initialization is crucial,
      initialize Global_interrupt_controller and Local_interrupt_controller
      at the same scope to enhance readability
    
    Implicitly, this commit removes a regression on ARMv8a boards with GICv2,
    like the Pinephone that was brought in by:

    hw: use X2APIC instead of LAPIC if possible on x86
    
    This commit introduces the X2APIC implementation in base-hw. To be able
    to keep the register definitions and usage in the class, this commit
    introduces a local "Mmio" access utility used by the underlying
    Genode::Mmio template, which uses the correct way to access the APIC,
    either by MSR or MMIO access.

    hw: enable ACPI X2APIC detection
    
    This commit extends the bootstrap ACPI code to detect X2APIC
    local-cpu interrup controller interfaces, and retrieve the
    APIC IDs of the different cpu cores.
    The current implementation is limited to APIC IDs beneath 0x100.
    If the hardware provides bigger IDs, the boot-process will fail.

Build system and tooling
########################

The practical evaluation of the new human-inclined data (HID) format
motivated improvements of the HID-processing tool _/tool/hid_ (formerly named
_/tool/hrd_), the run tool, and the _os/run/test.run_ utility.

HID processing
--------------

The hid tool located at _/tool/hid_ received a new option '-i', which applies
modification of a HID file in place. So the 'set', 'enable', 'disable', and
'remove' command can be used directly on a file.
Those manipulations have now been improved to largely preserve the formatting
of the existing file. So prior manual formatting and commenting work does no
longer go wasted when using the tool for subsequent data manipulation.

We slightly tweaked the style produced by the 'format' command. Those
tweaks are an ongoing iterative process to find the sweet spot for default
HID formatting. Do not take the current style as a given.

Run and test.run
----------------

The run tool has become able to tolerate the HID format in addition to XML.
Note that schema validation is currently performed only when using XML. The
definition of how to express a schema for HID is current work in progress.

The test.run script has been converted to use the _/tool/hid_ instead of
xmllint to retrieve information from test packages. Thanks to this change,
the runtime definitions of test packages can now be formatted as HID.
