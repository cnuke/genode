    implement devices manager
    
    The devices manager takes care of merging a static 'devices' ROM and a
    bitstream-dependent set of devices. The latter is specified by the
    component config. The result is provided in terms of a report and is
    intended to be consumed by the platform driver.

    drivers_fpga: allow switching between bitstreams
    
    In order to allow switching between bitstreams, the following changes
    are applied to the `driver_fpga-zynq` subsystem:
    
    - The `fpga_devices` ROM is replaced by a `devices_manager.config`.
    - The `fpga.bit` ROM is replaced by a File_system session. The file
      system is accessed by an internal `fs_rom` component translating ROM session
      request by the internal `fpga_drv`. The file system must therefore provide
      the bitstream data as well as a `/config` file containing the driver's
      config ROM.
    
    Fixes genodelabs/genode-zynq#2

    implement Pin driver
    
    The Pin driver for the Zynq-7000 SoC is largely based on the a64_pio_drv
    from the genode-allwinner repository. Most of the code could be shared
    and went into `common_types.h` and `main.cc`. The platform-specific
    parts (register interface, irqs, number of banks and pins) is thereby
    kept minimal.

    Zybo-Board GPIO demo
    
    The demo controls all on-board LEDs, buttons and switches. Since most
    GPIOs are connected to the PL, we must load a bitstream with the
    corresponding routing first. The demo also illustrates how to switch
    bitstreams at runtime.
    
    - Btn4 loads the bitstream allowing MMIO control of the RGB LEDs 5 & 6.
    - Btn5 loads the bitstream without support of RGB LEDs.
    - Sw0 controls Led0.
    - Sw1 controls Led1.
    - Sw2 controls Led2.
    - Sw3 controls Led3.
    - Btn0 controls the colour of Led5.
    - Btn1 controls the brightness of Led5.
    - Btn2 controls the colour of Led6.
    - Btn3 controls the brightness of Led6.

    fpga_drv: fix occasional freeze on reconfiguration
    
    Reconfiguration apparently also requires asserting the FPGA resets and
    setting the voltage level shifters. This is now supported by the
    platform driver, which provides the reset domain "fpga_nreset" for this
    purpose. By binding this reset domain to the devcfg device, the fpga
    driver is able to halt the fpga when it acquires the device and to reset
    the fpga when it releases the device.

Hardware-accelerated graphics with Intel GEN12+ GPUs
####################################################

With our big [https://mesa3d.org - Mesa 3D] library update from version 11.2.2
to version [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/21.08 - 21.0.0], we
also switched the Intel graphics back end from the dated DRI2/i965 to the
Gallium/Iris based graphics driver. The reason for doing so is becoming apparent
with the current Genode release. The old i965 driver does not support newer Intel
Graphics hardware and is limited to (U)HD graphics devices found, for example,
on Broadwell, Skylake, or Kabylake platforms. The new
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Xe - Intel Xe] (eXascale for
everyone = GEN12) hardware is only supported by the Iris driver and can be found
on current architectures like Tigerlake or Alderlake. Intel Xe comes with a
completely new instruction set architecture (ISA). Thanks to our switch to Iris,
most of these ISA changes are handled transparently by the Mesa library for us.
The main task for Genode was to adjust our Intel GPU multiplexer to the new
graphics-device generation.


Intel GPU-GEN12 multiplexer adjustments
=======================================

Genode's GPU multiplexer is a very low level component within the 3D graphics
stack. Technically, it handles the GPU resources (like graphics memory) and the
scheduling and execution of compiled GPU code (i.e., batch buffers) of the
graphics device. It is also responsible for providing separation of different
GPU clients, which is achieved by GPU contexts with a separate page table per
client in hardware. Also it serves interrupts and informs the clients,
respectively the 3D applications, about progress so a client can submit the
next rendering request. For Intel Xe, there are only two changes within this low
level ISA. First, the interrupt handling registers have been improved. It has
become easier to distinguish, for example, between a display-engine interrupt
and a rendering interrupt. Since graphics cards can have many interrupt causes,
this is a useful and welcome change. Second, it is now possible to schedule 16
instead of 4 jobs onto the GPU. While we don't take advantage of this feature
yet - we schedule one job at a time - this may come in handy on use cases like
3D compositing. Additionally, the multiplexer has to provide information about
slices, subslices, and EUs to Mesa clients.


Stability and resource improvements
===================================

Resources need to be traded on Genode and it is essential that the GPU
multiplexer does not pay for memory allocations or capability upgrades from it's
own budget. The client has to donate these resources beforehand. If this rule is
violated, the multiplexer might run out of budget and stall all clients. Because
3D applications can require a huge amount of resources, this has been a
challenging topic during the last release cycle and we are glad to announce that
even sophisticated workloads are now running well on Genode. There is still room
for improvement, but the current situation is already reassuring.
Stability-wise, we have tested the updated 3D stack with various workloads (games,
browsers, VirtualBox6-3D) and did fix all issues that we came across.


Base framework and OS-level infrastructure
##########################################

Base API changes
================

New 'Dictionary' utility
------------------------

Throughout the Genode code base, there are several places where objects are
accessed by using a name as key. To avoid the repeated manual crafting of such
data structures, we introduced a basic 'Dictionary' data structure located at
_base/include/util/dictionary.h_.

It follow the patterns of the existing 'Id_space' and 'Registry'. That is,
elements are automatically added to the dictionary at construction time,
respectively removed at destruction time. There exists an 'with_element'
method for applying a functor to one element by specifying a name as key, and
an 'with_any_element' method that can be used to destruct all dictionary
items.


Tightening the 'Xml_node' interface
-----------------------------------

The former 'with_sub_node' method has been renamed to 'with_optional_sub_node'
to better reflect the intention of the caller. If no sub node of the specified
type exists, the specified functor is not executed.

Use cases where a sub node is mandatory are best covered by the new
'with_sub_node' method that takes two functors as arguments, one called with
the matching sub node, and one that is called if no such sub node exists.


NIC router
==========

The NIC router now generates reports triggered by internal events
(re-configuration, link state change, etc.) asynchronously. This has the
benefit that the potentially expensive report update does not delay the event
processing that triggered the update and that a report is guaranteed to reflect
a consistent state of the router's internals.

Furthermore, if the '<report>' attribute 'link_state_triggers' is set, the router now
updates the report also whenever a network session gets constructed or
destructed. This is definitely necessary with sessions whose link state
is "up" because we should consider a non-existent session to be "down".
However, in real-world scenarios, a subscriber might want to know about the
construction and destruction of sessions that are "down" as well because one
has to be able to synchronize the lifetime of local objects that keep track
of the link states.

Beside the polishing of the report functionality, there are some improvements
related to the DHCP processing in the router. First, the router is now robust
against invalid DNS addresses in DHCP ACK packets. Next, the DHCP client
doesn't produce oversized Ethernet packets anymore. This is important in
networks with a low bandwidth. Then, the link state of a session that is bound
to the state of a another domain via the '<dhcp-server>' attribute
'dns_config_from' is now correctly synchronized to whether that domain has an
IP configuration or not. And, last but not least, the DHCP server now accepts
the optimized startup sequence of clients like Debian that store their lease
persistently and directly try re-requesting it on boot-up (no DHCP DISCOVER).
These last two changes both prevent DHCP re-attempts that could cause a
significantly delayed network boot-up at applications behind the router.


Improved support for time-multiplexed GPIO pins
===============================================

Prompted by the need to enable a bit-banging I2C driver on the PinePhone,
we extended Genode's pin-driver framework introduced in version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/21.11#Pin_I_O_session_interfaces - 21.11]
with the support for the time-multiplexed operation of a pin as output or
input.

To operate pin in both directions, a driver obtains both a pin-state and a
pin-control session for the same pin. The pin-state session can be used to
sense the current pin state. The control session allows the client to set the
pin to high or low (using the 'state' method), or to set it to high-impedance
via the 'yield' method. Once switched to high-impedance, the pin can be used
as input.


Libraries and applications
##########################

Emerging Sculpt OS variant for the PinePhone
============================================

Genode on the PinePhone has come a long way, most of which is covered by the
[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-platforms-22-05.pdf - Genode Platforms]
document. Device-driver work accounts for the majority of the effort, which is
nicely wrapped up with the current release as described in
Section [PinePhone drivers for audio, camera, and power control].
With the fundamental device drivers for the PinePhone covered, we can
now turn our attention to system-integrative work, ultimately raising the
question of how a Genode-based phone should best present itself to the user.

[image sculpt_pinephone_22_11]
  The forthcoming phone variant of the administrative user interface of
  Sculpt OS.

We take this question as an opportunity for exploration. Similarly to
how the so-called Leitzentrale of [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt OS]
provides the user with an administrative view on the system that is separate
from the user-defined desktop runtime, we pursued the division of the phone's
UI into two faces that can be toggled with a simple touch gesture.
The first one accommodates the role of the device as a fixed-function
appliance similar to the functionality of a feature phone whereas the second
one can be shaped entirely by the user. The screenshots above give a glimpse
of the user interface of the appliance side. It covers low-level device
parameters, voice calls, establishing network connectivity, and the
installation and management of the software running on the user-defined side.
One can see several cues from Sculpt OS such as the component graph.

The clear-cut separation of the two roles of the device opens up new ways to
leverage Genode's component architecture. For example, observing that the
appliance role needs only a subset of components, we can orchestrate the
startup of the system such that those components are started first. This way,
the device's basic functions like voice calls become available in under 7
seconds when powering-on the device.

Regarding the built-in feature set, we implemented the fundamental device
functions that everyone takes for granted, like displaying the battery
state, triggering the charging when a charger gets connected, controlling
the brightness of the display, or powering down the device.

The phone variant of Sculpt OS evolves in the
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner - genode-allwinner] repository,
specifically within the _sculpt/_ and _src/app/phone_manager/_ directories.
It can be built via the following command:

! built/arm_v8a$ make run/sculpt KERNEL=hw BOARD=pinephone SCULPT=phone

For loading the system on the PinePhone, please follow the instructions given
in the following article.

:Booting Genode on the PinePhone:

  [https://genodians.org/nfeske/2021-09-20-pine-fun-pinephone-boot]

Note that the current version is still at a rather developer-focused stage.
To avoid testimonies of a prematurely released version, we decided to postpone
the release of a ready-to-use image until the feature set generally expected
from a phone is complete and well tested.

PinePhone drivers for audio, camera, and power control
======================================================

Over the past 18 months, we have steadily expanded the base of device drivers
for the PinePhone, initially addressing the
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2021-12-21-pine-fun-display - display] and
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2022-03-16-pine-fun-touchscreen - touchscreen],
later covering the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/22.02#PinePhone_modem_access - modem],
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/22.05#Custom_system-control_processor__SCP__firmware - system control],
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/22.08#GPU_and_Mesa_driver_for_Mali-400 - GPU], and
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/22.08#SD-card_driver_for_the_PinePhone - SD-card].
With the current release, we wrap up this line of work with drivers for
audio, camera, and power control.

As a prerequisite step for enabling the camera, we changed the version of
Linux kernel that we use as donor of the driver code. Up to now, we relied on the
vanilla Linux kernel for the Allwinner SoC. However, the camera support still
resides on [https://xnux.eu - Ondrej Jirman's] custom kernel (orange-pi-5.14),
which is apparently the kernel of choice for most Linux distributions for the
PinePhone. We follow suit.


Audio
-----

The added audio support consists of two separate components, namely an
audio-control driver and audio in/out driver. The former controls the audio
routing and mixing on the hardware level. It is responsible to route the mic
to the modem during voice call, control the gain, or enable/disable the
speaker. The privacy-sensitive audio-control driver is meant to be part of the
base system of Sculpt. It operates according to its configuration, which can
be updated dynamically.

Volumes can be configured by nodes within the '<config>' node using a volume
attribute (range 0-100) where 0 implies turning off the input or output
device. Supported nodes are '<mic>', '<speaker>', and '<earpiece>'.
Furthermore, a '<codec>' node can be used to switch the audio path between the
modem and the ARM application processor (SoC). Its 'target' attribute can be
set to either "soc" (default) or "modem". The "soc" mode implicitly sets the
codec's sample rate to 44.1 KHz whereas "modem" mode sets the sample rate to
48 KHz. This distinction is required because the modem is compatible with 8
KHz only. The modem's 8 KHz can be cleanly converted to 48 KHz.

In contrast to the audio-control driver, the audio in/out driver is concerned
with streaming PCM audio data to/from the ARM application processor. It allows
audio applications hosted in the user-defined runtime of Sculpt OS to record
and play audio via Genode's audio-in and audio-out session interfaces.
The combination of both drivers can be exercised via the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-allwinner/blob/master/run/audio_pinephone.run - audio_pinephone.run]
script.


Power control
-------------

The new power-control driver is based on our custom firmware for the A64's
system-control processor (SCP) in combination with Genode's dedicated
scp-session interface that allow Genode components to interact with the SCP.

To properly arbitrate the access to the power-management IC (PMIC) between
the SCP firmware and the ARM application processor, the PMIC driver has been
moved entirely to the SCP side. This way, both the SCP firmware and
Genode-based SCP clients become able to safely access the PMIC without
stepping on each other's toes. In particular, the platform driver acts as an
SCP client to toggle power controls. Since the platform driver now depends
on the SCP, we co-located the formerly separate SCP driver component with the
platform driver.

Built upon this infrastructure, a new power driver exercises control over
several low-level aspects of the PinePhone hardware such as:

* Platform reboot (via the PMIC),
* Powering down the system (via the PMIC),
* Switching between the power profiles "performance" and "economic",
  which clock the ARM CPU at 1296 MHz and 816 MHz respectively,
* Reporting the remaining battery capacity, power draw, or charge current,
* Triggering the charging when connecting a charger, and
* Adjusting the backlight brightness.

Besides being integrated in Sculpt OS, the driver can be exercised in
isolation using the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-allwinner/blob/master/run/power_pinephone.run - power_pinephone.run]
script.


Camera
------

The added camera driver component consists of a port of the Linux SUN6I-CSI as
well as OV5640 and GC2145 drivers. It renders the captured camera image data
into a GUI session according to the following configuration attributes.

The 'camera' attribute selects the camera. Supported values as "front" and "rear".
The 'width' and 'height' attributes select the horizontal and vertical
resolution. Valid configurations are 640x480 as well as 1280x720.
The 'fps' attribute selects the capture rate of the camera. Valid values
are "15" and "30".
The 'format' attribute selects the capture format. The only valid value
is "yuv", which selects YUV420.
The 'convert' attribute specifies if the captured image data is converted
to the pixel format suitable for the GUI display. Default is "true".
The 'rotate' attribute specifies if the capture image data is rotated
counter-clockwise and flipped. Default is 'true'.

The integration of the driver is exemplified by the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-allwinner/blob/master/run/camera_pinephone.run - camera_pinephone.run] script.
The test scenario displays the camera image on the framebuffer. It repeatedly
switches between front and rear camera.

Audio driver updated to OpenBSD 7.1
===================================

We updated the audio-driver component to OpenBSD version 7.1 that
brings in support for playback on more recent 12th Gen Intel machines.
Besides the update, we remedied a long-standing shortcoming when
handling multiple HD-Audio devices and removed the support for old
audio devices.

The component contained a simple check to exclude known non-working devices
but depending on the machine's configuration, this check was incomplete. Rather
than extending the check, we took a step back and changed the probing
behavior of the component:

![init -> audio_drv] azalia0 [8086:160c]
![init -> audio_drv] :
![init -> audio_drv] azalia0: no supported codecs
![init -> audio_drv] azalia1 [8086:9ca0]
![init -> audio_drv] :
![init -> audio_drv] azalia1: codecs: Realtek ALC292
![init -> audio_drv] audio0 at azalia1

It now checks all available devices and picks the first
one it can use. This comes in handy in configurations where the virtual
PCI-bus is populated with all audio devices found in a machine and some of
them contain unsupported codecs as, among others, found on GPUs.

Furthermore, we decided to remove the _eap_ and _auich_ drivers as these drivers
rely on I/O port access, which still had to be enabled in the component after
the switch to the new platform driver and due to being of minor importance in
daily use.
The first one was mainly used to initially develop the component and later on
for testing in QEMU. The second one on the other hand was merely enabled to
provide a shot at getting audio in VirtualBox VMs where the component did not
work with the HDA device model at the time.

that both our projects face when using Linux drivers in unconventional ways to
improve system security.

    nova: avoid reset on machines with too many CPUs
    
    The NOVA kernel and Genode's roottask core are configured to be runnable
    with up to 64 CPUs (MAX_SUPPORTED_CPUS in core resp. NUM_CPU in kernel).
    On machines with more CPUs a reset occurred. The commit checks for this
    case, bootstraps the first 64 CPUs only, and sends all other CPUs to
    sleep.
    
    Also, the platform_info ROM size is increased to host information about
    more than 32 CPUs.

Build system and tools
######################

Streamlined building of libraries
=================================

The release adds special handling for 'lib/<libname>' arguments to the
build system, which supersedes the former 'LIB=<libname>' mechanism.
Whereas the old mechanism was limited to a single library, the new
convention allows multiple library arguments, similar to regular
targets.

The change brings the two immediate benefits. First, the streamlining of
library and target arguments allows for the building of libraries via the
'build' command of the run tool. Second, it alleviates the need for pseudo
_target.mk_ files for building shared libraries that have no direct
dependencies, in particular VFS plugins.

Note that _target.mk_ files located under _src/lib/_ are no longer reachable.
Therefore, all run scripts that used to trigger the build of a shared library
via a pseudo target must be adapted. E.g., 'build lib/vfs/tap' must be
replaced by 'build lib/vfs_tap'.

The former 'LIB=<libname>' option is no longer supported.


Boot-loading over HTTP
======================

The standard network-boot approach for x86 at Genode Labs has been a
combination of the PC-integrated Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), the
Pulsar boot loader, and the TFTP protocol for years. Because Pulsar is tight
to legacy BIOS interfaces, UEFI-only hardware demands for alternatives. iPXE
is a field-tested, UEFI-compatible alternative that is already supported in
Genode's run tool via _load/ipxe_.

One of the prominent features of iPXE is the support for additional network
(boot) protocols beyond TFTP with HTTP as a tempting option to improve boot
performance. This release enhances the _load/ipxe_ run module to optionally
configure and spawn the lightweight HTTP server _lighttpd_ to serve the boot
image to iPXE using the following declarations in _etc/build.conf_.

! RUN_OPT += --include load/ipxe
! RUN_OPT +=   --load-ipxe-base-dir /tftpboot
! RUN_OPT +=   --load-ipxe-boot-dir /ipxe
! RUN_OPT +=   --load-ipxe-lighttpd
! RUN_OPT +=   --load-ipxe-lighttpd-port 2209

The HTTP server is run only while the run tool is executed, killed on exit,
and limited to serve the contents of the test-specific directory under
*var/run/* in your build directory. Your iPXE boot loader should be
configured to chain the automatically generated _boot.cfg_ file
as follows.

! #!ipxe
! chain http://<host ip address>:2209/boot.cfg

Configurable Intel HWP mode
===========================

We updated our version of the Bender chain-boot loader to be configurable regarding the mode, in which
to run Intel's Hardware P-States (HWP). When running Genode on NOVA, The HWP
mode can now be controlled via the new run option '--bender-intel-hwp-mode'.
The option responds to the values 'off', 'performance', 'balanced', and
'power_saving'. The default value is 'performance' in order to stay backwards
compatible. On kernels other than NOVA, HWP remains turned off in general.
