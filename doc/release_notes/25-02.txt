    window_layouter: assignment of screens to displays
    
    This patch enhances the window layouter with the notion of displays
    and the assignment of screens to displays.
    
    Issue #5390

    wm/decorator/layouter: window clipping
    
    This patch changes the window-layout format to support the rectangular
    clipping of windows at screen boundaries. The new <boundary> node defines
    the clipping boundary for the windows listed within the node. Boundaries
    are expected to be disjoint. In the example below, the "vbox" window is
    placed partially outside the screen area of "screen_2".
    
    <window_layout>
      <boundary name="screen_1" xpos="0" ypos="0" width="640" height="480">
        <window id="1" title="launchpad" xpos="10" ypos="140" width="400" height=">
      </boundary>
      <boundary name="screen_2" xpos="640" ypos="0" width="800" height="600">
        <window id="2" title="vbox"     xpos="520" ypos="52" width="800" height="600">
        <window id="3" title="terminal" xpos="650" ypos="72" width="500" height="400">
      </boundary>
    </window_layout>
    
    The layouter uses boundaries to restrict the visiblilty of windows to
    their respective target areas.
    
    Until now, Sculpt relied on the fact that the window-layout ROM had the
    same structure as the resize-request ROM. With the addition of the
    <boundary> nodes, this is no longer the case. Therefore, the Sculpt
    manager generates a dedicated resize-request ROM now.

    window_layouter: drag windows between displays
    
    This patch allows the user to drag windows from one target area (i.e.,
    display) to another whereas the resizing of windows is restricted to
    the window's original target area. The latter point is important to
    ensure that the window's resize handles remain reachable at all times.

    window_layouter: allow screen-change during drag
    
    This patch enables the user to interactively change the assignment of
    windows to screens. For screens visible side by side in a multi-monitor
    setup, one can now move a window from one screen to another by dragging
    the window title. When using screens as virtual desktops on one display,
    a window can be moved to another screen by switching the screen (by
    pressing a key matching a desired screen) while the window is dragged
    with the mouse. So the user can drag the window between virtual desktops.

    window_layouter: modernized coding style
    
    Replace the use of pointers and the copying of XML nodes by the 'with_'
    pattern. Use plain struct where appropriate, replace constructors by { }
    initialization. Use C++20 function template syntax. Replace accessors by
    public constants where possible. Follow 'from_xml' convention. Follow
    usual 'Action' interface naming.

    window_layouter: restrict focus to visible windows
    
    This patch restricts the focus switching via the keyboard (Super-Tab) to
    windows located at visible screens.
    
    Should the currently focused window become invible, switch the focus to the
    most recently focused visible window.

    window_layouter: "pick_up" and "place_down" action
    
    The new 'action' attribute values can be used to realize the
    keyboard-based assignement of windows to screens. The "pick_up" action
    (on a key press) selects the focused window to be held at the current
    position until the "place_down" action is issued (by a key release).
    While the focused window is held, "screen" actions can be executed
    taking the picked up window to the selected screen.

    pkg/window_layouter: rules format change -> 24.12
    
    To accommodate multi-monitor window management, the window-layouter
    rules must be extended. By renaming the rules file to a version number
    reflecting the date of change (24.12), we prevent the loss of
    window-layout state when switching back and forth between different
    versions of the window-layouter.
    
    The default rules contain now the definition of three displays
    ("primary", "secondary", and "ternary") and map 3 screens to each
    display.

    window_layouter: handle drag/drop as actions
    
    This patch moves the formerly hard-wired drag-and-drop handling
    to the configuration level by introducing the actions "drag" and "drop".
    
    To aid the robust handling of release events matching their
    corresponding press events, the patch refines the policy-matching of the
    current combination of keys against the hierarchy of <press> and
    <release> nodes. If no policy for a concrete combination exists, a
    release event also considers the policy of its matching <press> node.
    This way, the regular drag-and-drop rules can be expressed as
    
      <press key="BTN_LEFT" action="drag">
         <release key="BTN_LEFT" action="drop"/>
      </press>
    
    This also works when releasing BTN_LEFT while pressing additional keys,
    for which no policy exists.
    
    With this change, the layouter supports the matching of multiple key
    sequences instead of only one, thereby supporting multiple actions at
    once and allowing for decoupling different user interactions in the
    configuration.

Date:   Tue Dec 10 17:53:45 2024 +0100

    window_layouter: free-arrange mode
    
    This patch adds the feature of moving and resizing windows by clicking
    anywhere within a window while the global window-management key is held.
    Depending on the position within the window, the click is interpreted as
    click on the title (when clicking at inner 50% of the window, or as a
    click on the border (when clicking at an area nearby the window
    boundary).
    
    This mode of interaction requires more flexibility of the handling of
    key sequences. The formerly hard-wired handling of the drag and drop as
    response to BTN_LEFT events does not suffice. Therefore, this patch
    moves the driving of the drag-and-drop state to the config level by
    introducing the actions "drag" and "drop"
    
    Fixes #5403

    vbox6: multi-monitor support
    
    Support dynamic panorama of virtual displays. Virtual monitors for
    VirtualBox must be configured in two steps.
    
    - <Display monitorCount="<num>"> nodes in the .vbox file defines the
      number of _connectors_ and, thus, the maximum number of connected
      virtual monitors.
    
    - Each enabled VirtualBox monitor requests a dedicated GUI session.
      Enablement and labeling of these sessions is done via <monitor>
      nodes in the component configuration like follows.
    
      <monitor label="DP-1"/>
      <monitor label="HDMI-A-1"/>
    
    Labels can be used by the window manager to configure and place the
    corresponding window. The order of the nodes directly controls the
    connection order at the virtual graphics card.

Init configuration improvements
===============================

Simplified RAM assignments
--------------------------

commit 1bbda2b963dbd6a0bf7044293ed7ea4bdc634bdd
author: norman feske <norman.feske@genode-labs.com>
date:   fri feb 7 17:29:35 2025 +0100

    init: ram quota as start-node attribute
    
    this patch allows for the assignment of ram to a start node via a new
    'ram' attribute as an alternative to traditional '<resource name="ram">'
    nodes. this makes configurations more concise.
    
    it also adds support for defining a configuration-global default ram
    quota, following the existing pattern of the default caps definition,
    e.g. the following <default> node alleviates the need to repeatedly
    state reasonable 'ram' and 'caps' values in each single start node.
    
      <default caps="100" ram="1m"/>
    
    fixes #5448

Partial session-label rewriting
-------------------------------

commit 00aef2643c702475f2d3709de8ac0dbf301959fe
Author: Norman Feske <norman.feske@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 12 15:17:35 2025 +0100

    init: make label rewriting more flexible
    
    This patch complements the existing 'label' attribute of session-route
    target nodes with the new 'identity', 'resource', and 'prepend_resource'
    attributes that allow for the partial rewriting of the label.
    
    Fixes #5447


Enriched file-system session-label convention
=============================================

; @nfeske

commit fb65e97eb0ffabf4c75065a357905a247d813b96
Author: Norman Feske <norman.feske@genode-labs.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 5 16:01:26 2025 +0100

    file-system session: root dir via session label
    
    This patch changes the way of how the client-selected sub directory is
    communicated to the server. The former opaque session argument is now
    passed as last label element, which allows for the flexible tweaking
    of this argument by init's session-routing and label-rewriting
    mechansims. In particular, it alleviates the need for creating chroot
    component instances.
    
    This change requires the following four adaptations at the
    configuration level:
    
    - Each file-system session request must now carry a path starting
      with / as last session arguments. Hence, <vfs> <fs> nodes that
      feature a 'label' attributes must extend the attribute value
      with " -> /". For <fs> nodes with no label attribute, "/" is
      used as last label argument by default.
    
    - For matching session-routing rules at init's configuration,
      the matching of full labels should be replaced by 'label_prefix'
      matches, excluding the last (path) argument.
    
    - Wherever a label of a file-system session is rewritten by using
      init's 'label' attribute of a <parent> or <child> target node,
      the new attribute 'identity' should be used instead. This replaces
      the identity part of the label while preserving the client's
      directory argument.
    
    - Analogously to the matching of session-routing rules, server-side
      policy-selection rules that formerly matched a concrete 'label'
      must be changed to match a 'label_prefix' instead.
    
    As a good practice, 'label_prefix' values should end with " ->" if
    possible, which clearly delimits the identity part of the label
    used by the matching.

Device drivers
##############

User-space IOMMU support for IRQ remapping
==========================================

While adding kernel-agnostic DMA protection in Genode
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/23.11#Kernel-agnostic_DMA_protection - 23.11],
we intentionally left IRQ protection out of scope. This release completes the
kernel-agnostic IOMMU enablement on Intel platforms by adding IRQ-remapping
support to the platform driver.

Since the platform driver already controls the MSI/MSI-X enablement for PCI
devices, setting up the corresponding remapping tables was rather straightforward.
Integrating remapping support for legacy interrupts, however, was a bit more
involved. It required us to also add support for the
_I/O APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller)_
to the platform driver. Similar to how the
_DMA Remapping Hardware Unit Defintions_ (DRHDs) are reflected in the _acpi_
report generated by the ACPI driver and added to the _devices_ report by our
PCI decode component, the available I/O APICs are now also part of the _devices_
report. With the added information, the platform driver is able to take over
control of the interrupt controller and set up IRQ remapping unless the
kernel already enabled IRQ remapping. Since the NOVA kernel already implements
IRQ remapping, the platform driver's I/O APIC and IRQ-remapping logic is
only effective on our base-hw kernel.

Note, as a prerequisite for handling IRQ remapping tables, we also needed to switch
from using the register-based invalidation interface to the queued invalidation
interface, which is the new default (if supported by the platform).

    hw: always serialize rdtsc reads
    
    While implementing TSC calibration in #5215, the issue of properly serializing
    TSC reads came up. Some learnings of the discussion were noted in #5430.
    
    Using `cpuid` for serialization as in Trace::timestamp() is portable,
    but will cause VM exits on VMX and SVM and is therefore unsuitable to
    retain a roughly working calibration loop while running virtualized.
    On the other hand on most AMD systems, dispatch serializing `lfence`
    needs to be explicitly enabled via a non-architectural MSR.
    
    Enable setting up dispatch serializing lfence on AMD systems and always
    serialize rdtsc accesses in Hw::Tsc::rdtsc() for maximum reliability.

Build system and tools
######################

Goa SDK
=======

While working on several ports of 3rd-party software using the Goa SDK, we
further tweaked its support of commodity build systems. This includes the
propagation of shared-library linker flags and the execution of 'make install'
in autoconf-based and make-based projects. Moreover, Goa used to symlink the
complete content from a project's _src/_ directory into the build directory.
As this could create ping-pong effects with generated files, Goa now leaves
generated files untouched (unless provided with the '--rebuild' flag).

Autoconf-based projects are now pointed to the used API archives for looking up
pkg-config files. This prevents pkg-config from accidentally pulling library
information from the host system and instead only take this information from
_*.pc_ files in the referenced depot archives.

Furthermore, we updated the built-in depot archive versions to Sculpt 24.10.3.
