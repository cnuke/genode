The audio driver includes support for Intel HD Audio devices (azalia).
It is primarily tested on real hardware but might also work in VMs like
VirtualBox.


Usage and configuration
=======================

Reporting of the mixer state is enabled by adding the 'report_mixer'
attribute to the drivers configuration and setting its value to 'yes'.

The following snippets illustrates the format of the report:

!<mixer_state>
!  <mixer field="inputs.beep" value="108"/>
!  <mixer field="outputs.hp_sense" value="plugged"/>
!  <mixer field="outputs.master" value="128,128"/>
!  <mixer field="outputs.mic_sense" value="unplugged"/>
!  <mixer field="outputs.spkr_muters" value="hp,mic"/>
!</mixer_state>

The mixer state may expose other mixer fields as well, depending on the
used sound card. The naming scheme of the attributes intentionally
matches the naming scheme of OpenBSD's mixerctl(1) program.

Each 'mixer' node can be used to configure the audio driver by using it
in its configuration, e.g.:

!<config report_mixer="yes">
!  <mixer field="outputs.master" value="255,255"/>
!</config>

This configuration will set the output volume to the highest possible
value. Although it is now also possible to update the configuration
at run-time it should not be done while the driver is currently playing
or recording because it may provoke the generation of artefacts.

The driver supports using the Audio_out and Audio_in sessions as well as
the Play and Record sessions. It defaults to Audio_out/Audio_in but can
be switched by setting the 'record_play' attribute to 'true' in the
config node.

The following snippet shows the driver configured for playback and recording
using the Play and Record sessions:

! <start name="pci_audio">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!   <config record_play="true">
!     <mixer field="outputs.master" value="255"/>
!     <mixer field="record.enable" value="on"/>
!     <mixer field="record.adc-0:1_source" value="mic3"/>
!     <mixer field="record.volume" value="128"/>
!   </config>
! </start>

In case the Audio_out and Audio_in sessions are used the driver operates
as a server and should provide the sessions:

! <start name="pci_audio">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!   <provides>
!     <service name="Audio_out"/>
!     <service name="Audio_in"/>
!   </provides>
!   <config>
!     ...
!   </config>
! </start>

It is vital to enable recording by setting 'record.enable' to 'on' as
otherwise only silence will be delievered to the Audio_in session.
In addition to selecting the recording source, the playback as well as the
recording volume are set. When a single value is given the same value is
used for all channels. Depending on the used HDA device or rather the used
codec the available fields might differ and a different recording source
must be set for 'adc-0:1'. For example on a Thinkpad X220 the source must
be set to 'mic3' to select the internal microphone.

Information about the available mixers and settings in general
may be obtained by setting the 'verbose' to 'yes' in the config
node.

When multiple microphones are present (e.g., internal microphone in a notebook
and a headset with a microphone), the preferred microphone can be configured
using the 'mic_priority' attribute in the '<config>' node. Valid values are
"internal" and "external" (default).

! <config mic_priority="internal"/>

The example above tells the driver to prioritize the internal microphone over a
headset.


Examples
========

Playback can be tested by executing the run script
'repos/dde_bsd/run/audio_out.run'.
It will play a raw sample file in a loop. The file format is header less
two channel float 32 at 44100 Hz. You may use the 'sox' utility to create
such an audio file:

! sox -c 2 -r 44100 foo.wav foo.f32

Recording, on the other hand, can be tested by executing the run script
'repos/dde_bsd/run/audio_in.run'.

It will use a simply audio monitor test component that records samples
and plays them back immediately.
