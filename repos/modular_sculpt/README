    Modular Sculpt for testing on various hardware

The configuration contained in this repository relies on the fact that
all test machines follow the same partition-table scheme and provides
the necessary recipes and required presets and launchers.

# USB

Some usb devices are already passed through to both compartments (see the
in-preset-defined usb file in modular_sculpt/sculpt/usb/Slot_A).
If you want to use them in a specific compartment, remove the entry
corresponding to the device from the policy for the other compartment. For
Slot_A_B tests modular_sculpt/sculpt/usb/Slot_A_B does not pass any USB
device to the compartments, which can be changed online and offline.

To change usb policies, open /config/usb in the provided system shell and
edit it. Missing devices can be added as well; to view available/plugged
in devices, see the file /report/runtime/usb_devices.
