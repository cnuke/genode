This directory contains the implementation of a NVMe driver component.


Brief
=====

The driver supports PCIe NVMe devices matching at least revision 1.1 of
the NVMe specification. For now it only supports one name space and uses
one completion and one submission queue to handle all I/O requests; one
request is limited to 1MiB of data. It lacks any name space management
functionality.


Configuration
=============

The following config illustrates how the driver is configured:

!<start name="nvme_drv">
!  <resource name="ram" quantum="24M"/>
!  <provides><service name="Block"/></provides>
!  <config hmb_size="16M">
!    <policy label_prefix="client1" writeable="yes"/>
!  </config>
!</start>

The 'hmb_size' instructs the driver to setup a host-memory-buffer
of 16 MiB of DMA-capable memory if the device requires the buffer.


Report
======

The driver supports reporting of active name spaces, which can be enabled
via the configuration 'report' sub-node:

!<report namespace="yes"/>

The report structure is depicted by the following example:

!<controller model="QEMU NVMe Ctrl" serial="FNRD">
! <namespace id="0" block_count="32768" block_size="512"/>
!</controller>
