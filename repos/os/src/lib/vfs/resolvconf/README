The _resolvconf_ VFS plugin amends the IP address contained in the
'nameserver' file exposed by the TCP/IP VFS plugins like _lwip_
and _lxip_ to provide the common 'resolv.conf' structure.

The 'nameserver_file' attribute denotes where the nameserver file
is located and defaults to '/socket/nameserver'.

The 'name' attributes specifies how the file the plugin provides
is called and defaults to 'resolv.conf'.

The following config snippet illustrates its usage:

!<config>
!  <vfs>
!    <dir name="socket"> <lxip dhcp="yes"/> </dir>
!    <dir name="etc"> <resolvconf/> </dir>
!  </vfs>
!</config>
