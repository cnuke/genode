This directory contains a clock view component. It generates
a menu_view configuration from a timestamp, which is update
in the given interval.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical example configuration looks as follows.

! <config utc_offset="2" offset="1505917828" interval="5" date="yes"/>

In this example, the menu_view configuration is updated every 5 seconds
and will show the date (YYYYMMDD) along side the current time. The 'offset'
denotes the base time, e.g. read from an RTC, in seconds from the UNIX epoch
and is incremented at the intervals pace.
