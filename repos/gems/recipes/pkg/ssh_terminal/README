  This package provides a Terminal session via SSH

It contains a default configuration that uses a ed25519 host key and
is configured with login for user 'sculpt' with the password 'sculpt'
on the usual SSH port '22'. The IP is statically set to '10.0.1.222'.

For now the host key must be generated externally for example by using
'ssh-keygen(1)' from OpenSSH:

  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ed25519_key -q -N ""
